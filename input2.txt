Raindrops falling on the ground,
Ground beneath our weary feet.
Feet dance lightly, soaked with joy,
Joy in every drop we greet.

Greet the morning, greet the day,
Day awakes with gentle sound.
Sound of rain, a soothing song,
Song of nature all around.

Around us, trees with leaves so green,
Green and fresh, kissed by the rain.
Raindrops falling, falling free,
Free to wash away our pain.
